## Collection of Homework and Class Activities 

This repository is a collection of class activities and homework.  It represets the evolution of learning to write and 
understand code and reflects the myriad of tools acquired over the course of this bootcamp.  The year 2020 has been an 
interesting one, to say the least.  Our class began as a traditional in-person learning set-up and quickly became an on-line 
virtual set-up, with the onset of the Corona Virus pandemic.  At times, this became a test of endurance, as classmates weathered 
on-line connectivity issues, out-right computer failure, and the actual virus.  In the end, I can say I have benefitted 
from the adjustment struggles and have a solid foundation on which to further my learning in what is a cutting-edge field.
